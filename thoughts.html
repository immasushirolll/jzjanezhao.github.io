        <h2>Thoughts Log</h2>
        <p>Log 2 (May 10): Two topics that have come up recently: dopamine overdose, addiction, and depression. So maybe 3,
            but the heart of this discussion was the impact of stimulants on depression and the phenomenon we see in young
            people these days. Also another slightly related (everything's related) but more lifestyle focused topic is the
            ever decreasing metabolism in people these days. It's now not just what you're putting in, but also can you put
            it out? It's more important that you increase your amount of mitochondria and mitochondrial activity and
            efficiency so you can maximally utilize your intake.
        </p>
        <p>Log 1 (Apr 24): Listening to a Hubermanlab podcast about addiction in teens right now, and something that 
            I thought was an interesting and hopeful reminder of why we say the youth in our society are our future. 
            So the guest speaker was talking about what was the most effective way to get teenagers to really fairly weigh 
            the benefits and detriments of vaping, and her main point was to take advantage of the absolute defiance in
            children to be manipulated, for better or for worse; "never undervalue the spirit of defiance in youth" as 
            a source for change, for innovation. This is why it's so important we take advantage of such a widely available
            resource, why companies look to these young people.
