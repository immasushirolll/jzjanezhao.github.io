            <p>Log 5 (May 8): note: set container display: grid to get the columns to stay locked in place, so for this that helped 
                prevent the nav buttons from moving with the changing content. My friend just told me to change it to pages :( ugh.</p>
            <p>Log 4 (May 7): Got the buttons working! Had to use JS.</p>
            <p>Log 3 (May 2): Formatted navigation buttons to go to respective sections, want to add a thing where it switches
                 to the section that's clicked on and then it shows all the content in that section as a drop down. 
                 May need to use JS, figure out later. Also changed theme to dark.</p>        
            <p>Log 3 (Apr 30): Formatted columns and put navigation buttons, not yet functional.</p>
            <p>Log 2 (Apr24): Forgot to mention, picture problem is fixed basically just cropped the photo and set the number of 
                pixels manually, now I'm trying to fix a formatting problem, 
                keeps going out of bounds.
            </p>
            <p>Log 1 (Apr 23): Started making it finally! Biggest and first challenged faced is my profile pic constantly
            distorting

            <h2>Thoughts Log</h2>
            <p>Log 1 (Apr 24): Listening to a Hubermanlab podcast about addiction in teens right now, and something that 
                I thought was an interesting and hopeful reminder of why we say the youth in our society are our future. 
                So the guest speaker was talking about what was the most effective way to get teenagers to really fairly weigh 
                the benefits and detriments of vaping, and her main point was to take advantage of the absolute defiance in
                children to be manipulated, for better or for worse; "never undervalue the spirit of defiance in youth" as 
                a source for change, for innovation. This is why it's so important we take advantage of such a widely available
                resource, why companies look to these young people.
